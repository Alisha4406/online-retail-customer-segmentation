# Online Retail Customer Segmentation

This project performs customer segmentation using the UCI Online Retail dataset.
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features are engineered and KMeans clustering
is applied to identify distinct customer groups.
The objective of this task is to perform unsupervised learning on the Online Retail dataset to identify customer segments using clustering technique.
The task includes data preprocessing ,feature scaling ,applying clustering algorithms, visualizing the results to understand customer behaviour.


## Techniques Used
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Scaling
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchial Clustering
- Silhouette Score Evaluation
- PCA
- t-SNE
- Umap
- Heatmap visualization
